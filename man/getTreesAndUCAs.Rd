\arguments{
\item{clones}{AIRR-table containing sequences \link{formatClones}}

\item{data}{The AIRR-table that was used to make the clones object.}

\item{dir}{The file path of the directory of where data is saved. NULL is default.}

\item{build}{Name of the tree building method}

\item{exec}{File path to the tree building executable}

\item{model_folder}{The file path to the OLGA default model files for heavy chains}

\item{model_folder_igk}{The file path to the OLGA default model files for IGK}

\item{model_folder_igl}{The file path to the OLGA default model files for IGL}

\item{uca_script}{The file path to the UCA python script}

\item{python}{Specify the python call for your system. This is the call
on command line that issues the python you want to use. 
"python" by default.}

\item{id}{The run ID}

\item{max_iters}{The maximum number of iterations to run before ending}

\item{nproc}{The number of cores to use}

\item{rm_temp}{Remove the generated files?}

\item{quiet}{Amount of noise to print out}

\item{chain}{Set to HL to use both heavy and light chain sequences}

\item{references}{Reference genes. See \link{readIMGT}}

\item{clone}{The name of the clone id column used in \link{formatClones}}

\item{cell}{The name of the cell id in the AIRR table used to generate \link{formatClones}}

\item{heavy}{The name of the heavy chain locus. Default is IGH.}

\item{sampling_method}{How to subsample. Methods include 'random', 'lm' (least mutated),
and 'ratio' (a weighted sampling with heavier weights
towards the least mutated sequences). The later two methods
require 'mu_freq' to be passed as a trait when running
\link{formatClones}}

\item{subsample_size}{The amount that the clone should be sampled down to. Default is NA. Use NA if you do not wish to subsample -- in testing}

\item{search}{Search codon or nt space}

\item{check_genes}{Check if the inferred V/J lengths go into the inferred cdr3 region and adjust accordingly.}

\item{igblast}{File path to igblast}

\item{igblast_database}{The file path to the database setup for igblast}

\item{ref_path}{The file path to your references parent folder.}

\item{organism}{The type of organism to align to if using igblast.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to various other functions like \link{getTrees} and \link{buildGermline}}
