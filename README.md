Dowser
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dowser is part of the [Immcantation](http://immcantation.readthedocs.io) 
analysis framework for Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing 
(AIRR-seq). Dowser provides a set of tools for performing phylogenetic analysis
on B cell receptor repertoires. It supports building and visualizing trees using 
multiple methods, and implements statistical tests for discrete trait analysis
of B cell migration, differentiation, and isotype switching.


Dowser has 6 primary functions:

1. Reconstruct clonal germline sequences.
2. Build B cell lineage trees using multiple methods, such as maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and IgPhyML.  
3. Reconstruct intermediate sequences within lineage trees using different methods. 
4. Create publication-quality lineage tree plots.
5. Analyze trees to detect ongoing B cell evolution over time.
6. Understand B cell migration and differentiation.
