Dowser
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dowser is part of the [Immcantation](http://immcantation.readthedocs.io) 
analysis framework for Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing 
(AIRR-seq). Dowser provides a set of tools for performing phylogenetic analysis
on B cell receptor repertoires. It supports building and visualizing trees using 
multiple methods, and implements statistical tests for discrete trait analysis
of B cell migration, differentiation, and isotype switching.

Dowser is released under the AGPL-3 license.

For detailed instructions on usage, check out the [Dowser documentation site](https://dowser.readthedocs.io)
